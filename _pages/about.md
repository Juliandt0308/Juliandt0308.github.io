Hello, I am Geon Kim, a bachelor student in Sungkyunkwan University. I am interested in games and artificial intelligence. I am currently having two majors: One is Business Administration, and the other is Computer Science. I have studied in this university since 2020, and so far I have got 95 credits with GPA 4.32. From 2021 to 2022, I paused university course due to mandatory military service, and I resumed it from 2023.
